Hi Ludger

I wanted to convince myself that the 10:90 split on positive:negative
values only affects the intercept.

So, I came up with this R script which shows it quite nicely for me
and will help in a discussion I need to have with you on interpretaion
of LR model coefficients.

If you drop in the script PosNegSplit.R and run it you should get a
2x2 plot like the attached PosNegSplit.pdf file.

I created 100 positive cases from a N(12,1) distribution
I created 99,900 negative cases from a N(15,1) distribution

The idea here is to simulate some experiment with just one predictor,'obs'
with a binary response. The numbers are supposed to reflect what we get in 
the hypotension observations i.e. relatively rare event.

The top line in the 2x2 plot shows the experiment results, black dashed line
is the mixture distribution, red=pos cases, blue=neg cases.

I then run 5 glm() LR models always using the 100 positive cases but with
varying amounts of negative cases. 

Model   Samples (pos:neg)  Mix Ratio
1       100:100             50:50
2       100:400             20:80
3       100:900             10:90
4       100:4,900            2:98
5       100:99,900         0.1:99.9

The intercept and coefficient from the model for 'obs' are shown on 
the bottom row of the 2x2 plot.

As you said, the intercept changes with model number. Interestingly, the 
coefficient for 'obs' also changes if you have an even (ish) split of positive
to negative cases but then settles from 10:90 onwards. This suggests my 10:90
split for the thesis is defensible. It does suggest that you do have to be aware
of the problem.

On the point of interpretation of the coefficient for 'obs', my understanding
it that the coefficient is the change for 1 unit increase in the predictor and if 
you want to get this into probability you need to do exp(coef) which in this 
case gives about 5%. So I read that as for each unit increase in the 'obs' value
(which ranges from 9 to 19) you would expect a 5% decrease (because of negative 
coefficient) in the probability of response = 1.

This was how I came up with the 'comment' column in tables 5.17 and 5.18 which you
are not convinced about. 

Hope this makes some sense. We probably need a phone or Skype chat on this one.

Bye

Rob
